## Description

We have a dataset which contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. We have 57,355 rows and 31 columns. All the columns we have are in numeric form which was obtained after PCA transformation. Due to confidentiality issues, the dataset doesn't have the original features and more background information about the data.

Follow the steps in [getting started](#getting-started)

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo into your local machine.

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/itsmeSamrat/CreditCardFraudAnalysis-Using-Pytorch.git
```

- Install all the packages and libraries from requirement.txt file
- Run the code. It should run as it is.
- Use other ML models or NN to increase the Recall score of the model.
- Support by staring the repo 🙂😁.
